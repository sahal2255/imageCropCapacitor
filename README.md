🏹 Image Cropper with Native Android Support!
 
I'm excited to share a small project I just completed — an Image Cropper tool built using React and React Image Crop, and converted into a native Android app using Capacitor.
📌 Features:
Upload and crop images with adjustable aspect ratio
Live preview of the cropped result
Fully responsive UI with TailwindCSS
Powered by Capacitor to generate a native Android experience from a web project
⚙️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
Image Cropper: react-image-crop
Native App: CapacitorJS
📱 With Capacitor, I was able to wrap this web app into a native Android app quickly and efficiently — bringing the power of web and native together!
 Check out the video below to see the app in action!
