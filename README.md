# 🏹 Image Cropper with Native Android Support!

I'm excited to share a small project I just completed — an **Image Cropper Tool** built using **React** and **React Image Crop**, and converted into a **native Android app** using **CapacitorJS**.

## 📌 Features

- 📤 Upload and crop images with an adjustable aspect ratio  
- 🖼 Live preview of the cropped result  
- 📱 Fully responsive UI with TailwindCSS  
- 📲 Native Android support using CapacitorJS  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS  
- **Image Cropping**: [`react-image-crop`](https://github.com/DominicTobias/react-image-crop)  
- **Native Wrapper**: [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/)  

## 📱 Native App Conversion with Capacitor

Using **Capacitor**, I was able to wrap this web app into a **native Android application**, combining the power of web technologies with a smooth native experience.
